    "# UCalib\n",
    "\n",
    "`UCalib` is an open source software written in Python for automatic image calibration from a set of images that are manually calibrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "The calibration algorithm assumes that the camera position and the intrinsic parameters of the camera remain unchanged. The result of the process is a common position and intrinsic camera parameters for all images, and the orientation of the cameras for each of the images. In addition, planviews can be generated for each image. The development of this software is suitable for Argus-type video monitoring stations. Details about the algorithm and methodology are described in\n",
